# CPU board

Some thoughts:

* Expansion connector should have more GNDs.  So maybe 50 pins.
* Should the buses be buffered?  Expansion buses?
* Integrated IDE interface?  Ditch the PIO for 8255 for this?
* Simpler baud rate generator?
* Ensure SIO pinout compatible with FTDI module/cable
 (or integrate FTDI modules on board)
