		Z80ASM 1.30 Release Notes

Bugs Fixed From 1.25:

Nested macro calls using % operator fixed
IFIDN	<>,<>	now returns true
JR	NUMBER+$	generates correct code
INCLUDE and MACLIB filenames can now contain +, -, etc
Fixed number conversion in non-power-of-two radix
.$$1 files are cleaned up on abort
	LD	A,TYPE 0	works
ex	af,af'		works in U/L mode


Additions:

All input and output files are always closed upon termination (unless
terminated by ^C from BUFIN call).

CONFIG option added to allow TABs in strings.  Normally Z80ASM complains
about any control characters in quoted strings but generates the correct
code.  This option suppress the error if the control character is a TAB.

CONFIG option added to disable stripping the high bit of each byte read
from the input source.  THIS IS DANGEROUS!  Should ONLY be used for using
non-ASCII characters in comments.  DO NOT USE in macros, since the high
bit is used as a parameter replacement flag.  Other indexed tables also
assume the high bit is clear.
